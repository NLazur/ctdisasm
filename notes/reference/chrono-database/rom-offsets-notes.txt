C02E1E - Color Crash

The following routines store a color index and jump to C02E1E color crash code.

Dark Blue - Location index > $01FF
C00077 - This code may not be reachable.  The routines right before it will jump to the overworld code if the map is 01F0 or higher

Light Blue - No string index set (7E012D bank byte = $00)
C03574 - Event Command BB, textbox
C035B9 - Event Command C1, textbox
C03600 - Event Command C2, textbox
C03647 - Event Command C0, dec box
C036AE - Event Command C3, dec box
C036E1 - Event Command C4, dec box

Pink - Packet isn't being decompressed to 7F8000-7FFFFF range
C046CF - Event Command 82, load NPC
C04838 - Event Command 83, load enemy

Purple - Related to loaded sprite graphics?
C05CB0 - Event Command 82 & 83 subroutines

Dark Yellow - Packet begins with $0D0A BETA format
C05CD7 - Event startup

Red - Decompressed event packet too large, > $1700
C05CE5 - Event startup

Light Yellow - Event command not valid
C05F6E - Event Command 01 and others



C05C90 

Seems to be responsible for checking if a sprite's graphics are already loaded, and if not the next available slot.  This function is called by Load NPC and probably the other Load Sprite functions as well.



Menu and Battle Routine Observations

In general, routines and data in the 3DA800-3DBFFF range is battle related (mainly battle initialization it appears) that there was too much of to fit into bank $01

In general, the data in bank $3F is used by routines in the second half of bank $02, mainly menu related.  In addition, the end of bank $3F contains some routines for saving, etc. that there was too much of to fit into bank $02



Debug battle flags:

01FFFF set to non-zero value to enable
When Select is pressed on Controller 2, all enemies are instantly defeated. In the BETA version, this feature is on by default

0D3FFF set to non-zero value to enable
When R shoulder button is pressed on Controller 1, $00 stored to 7ECD02 and 7ECD03, unknown purpose

0FFFFD set to non-zero value to enable
Stores $00 to 7EAE9B and 7EAE94, attack related?

0FFFFE set to non-zero value to enable
Stores $40 to 7EAE94 and $00 to 7EAE9B, attack related?

0FFFFF set to non-zero value to enable
Stores $80 to 7EAE9B and $00 to 7EAE94, attack related?
