The Trial:

Here are the conditions for each Juror, taken straight from the game's event data. Note that these Jurors are in the order presented in the event data, and may not be the same order as they come in.

Juror 1
- If you were "Just a bit" tempted, guilty.
- If you tried to sell Marle's pendant, guilty.
- Innocent.


Juror 2
- If you talked to the girl who lost her cat before bringing it back to her, guilty.
- If you brought the girl her cat back, innocent.
- If did not participate at all, 50% random chance, innocent.
- Guilty.

(Juror 2 is obviously bugged. It really ought to check for condition 2 first.)
(Juror 2's 50% random choice is not truly 50%.  The random number is the current frame displayed when entering the courtroom. It is refreshed if the game jumps to a cutscene of Crono's actions at the Millennial Fair.  The possible frame range is 00:3B, and the random number LEC adds 1, for a random number pool of 00FE01:00FE3C.  In this pool, there are 28 bytes of value 80 or below (Guilty), and 32 bytes of value 81 or above (Innocent)  The final result is a 53.3% chance of Not Guilty and 46.7% chance Guilty.)


Juror 3
- If Marle yells about being kidnapped, guilty.
- Innocent.


Juror 4
- If you were tempted by Marle's fortune, guilty.
- If you picked up the pendant before talking to Marle, guilty.
- Innocent.


Juror 5
